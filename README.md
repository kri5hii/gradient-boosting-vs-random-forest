# Gradient Boosting vs Random Forest

## Overview
This project compares the performance of two ensemble learning models:
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

Both models are evaluated on the Breast Cancer dataset.

## Dataset
Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn.
Binary classification problem (malignant vs benign).

## Methodology
1. Data split into training and testing sets.
2. Both models trained on the same data.
3. Predictions generated on test set.
4. Accuracy and classification report compared.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Ensemble Learning
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Model Comparison
- Classification Metrics

## Results
Accuracy and detailed classification reports are printed
for performance comparison.
